			<h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
			<p>My name is Rezan Eezaldin Othman, <br>
				I am from Qamshlo,Syria, <br>
				Web Developer from Flatiron School|Erbil (Re:Coded)</p>
				<p>I am a junior full-stack web developer with a desire to be the best video games developer in the Middle East. <br> I have strong technical and interpersonal skills and aspire to work in a challenging and fast paced team environment. </p>

				<h3>A glimpse of my life:</h3>
				<h4>Before Re:Coded</h4>
				<p>I was born in Syria at 1998 MC , <br>I was studing in Syria Until i reached to first Year in University, <br>
					I got my baccalaureate in 2015 and then I moved to the university to study at the Faculty of Economics at Al-Furat University in Al-Hasakah, <br> but I could not complete my studies there because of the war conditions in my country which began in 2011 and worsened year after year, <br>
					 This is why I was forced to leave my country, leave my family, my friends, my studies , <br> and travel to Iraq to continue my studies, build my future, and gain some of the security and stability that we lacked in our country because of the war.
				</p>
				<h4>Why I joined Re:Coded:</h4>
				<p>After leaving Syria and arriving in Iraq, I moved to live with my brother in Erbil in a Syrian refugee camp where I was planning to complete my university studies at a university in Erbil, but I was unable to present my school documents because I arrived at the end of 2015
					 At that time, the university registration deadline was over and I was thinking that I had lost one year of my studies
					So I decided to go and find something that would benefit me until the new school year and enter the university
					Because I'm good at computer maintenance, I moved to work with my friend in computer and mobile maintenance
					During a short period of work in that area, my brother told me that there is a US organization that will come on a specific date to the camp to test people, choose them and train them to make them skilled programmers in the future, <br>
					i take a look at the announcement and what the work of the organization and its objectives, <br>
					I was ready to prepare for the arrival of the organization to enter the test because I dreamed that one day became a developer of the video games and I saw that Re:Coded can help me achieve my dream, <br>
					I have already been able to enter the test and have been successful and accepted to work with the organization. <br>
					In this period I left everything and focused on Re:Coded just to become a skillful programmer,and reaching my dream of becoming a skilled game developer. <br>
					Now  I managed to learn many coding Languages from Re:Coded which is : <br>
					Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS,SQL, VBA Access <br> <br>
					Every thing in my life become best with Re:Coded.
				</p>
				<h5>NOW JUST I WANT TO SAY ONE THING:	<br> <br> // RE:CODED CHANGE MY LIFE TO THE BEST //</h5>
				<h4>After Re:Coded:</h4>
				During my studies at Re:Coded
				I was able to enter a university in Erbil after submitting the university documents to an organization called Spark, which is responsible for providing facilities for Syrian students to pursue their studies in Iraq. <br>
				Now I am studying at Al Bayan University in the Faculty of Computer Science, <br>
				And now I aspire to graduate from university , and
				 Put everything i learned in Re:Coded and from the university to enter the world of developing video games and create a lot of applications that would add help
				 And a distinctive touch to the world.
